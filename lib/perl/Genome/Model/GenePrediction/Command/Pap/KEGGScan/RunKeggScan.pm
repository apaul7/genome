=head1 NAME

RunKeggScan.pm

=head1 USAGE

 Your query sequence file should be of nucleotide FASTA format. The subject database should be a FASTA of protein sequences as retrieved from the KEGG FTP site (ftp://ftp.genome.ad.jp/pub/kegg/). As of this writing, the genes file can be found by downloading and unpacking sequences.tar.gz from KEGG; the file needed is simply called "genes".

 NOTE: The 'KeggRelease' line entry must ONLY contain a single numeric portion.  This code uses this number to determine the expected formatting of the genes db fasta file with regards to the KO numbers.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

KEGGscan was written to compare nucleotide sequence (full length cDNAs, genes, clustered ESTs) to the KEGG gene database of /currated protein sequences. Sequences in the KEGG database have known, annotated Enzyme Commission (EC) ids associated with them. By aligning query sequence against annotated sequence we can assign putative function by EC number association. Obviously, the better the resolution of the query sequence, the more believable our results will be.  The BLAST used to make our alignments uses the topcomboN=1 argument to return only the "best" result. A routine takes the KEGG genes FASTA file and revises it, creating a version with only entries that have associated Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers.

The following logic filters the match list. Top hits are determined on a one-to-one basis (1 group hit per query). The rules for hits are:

=over 5

=item 1

Lowest p_value determines top match.                                   

=item 2

If other HSPs tie the lowest p_value, highest bit score prevails.      

=item 3

If p_value, bit scores are identical, then choosing any 1 of the hits is equally representative.

NOTE: Looks like KEGG genes files always have subject_name in 1st col & EC in last. If this ever changes, we'll have to update this routine....
